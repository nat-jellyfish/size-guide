## Abstract
As of 2024, according to the website Statista, 16 percent of the total retail sales were e- commerce while the rest were from brick and motor stores. By 2040 it is estimated that the total will be 95 percent. 

Customers purchasing online can’t see, smell, touch, or try the products before purchasing. Specifically, this is a challenge when shopping for clothing. Customers may find an item online that they want to purchase; however, they may be unsure if the clothing will suit their body shape.

Today, there is no universal solution for trying on clothing items digitally or through an e- commerce website.

## Solution
Create an augmented reality app that gives e- commerce shoppers size recommendations and fit visualization. 

Using the shopper’s camera, we can capture the measurements in real time from the customer’s body. 

Sellers can upload clothing items and varies sizes which will be used to select the optimal shopper’s fit.
